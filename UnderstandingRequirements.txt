
 Step 1: Understanding the Requirements

         For that, we need to:

        (1) Monitor Solana blockchain transactions.

        (2) Identify new wallets buying a specific token for the first time.

        (3) Check if they have extra Solana left after the purchase.

        (4) Send alerts (e.g., Telegram, Discord, Email) when a potential buyer is found.
